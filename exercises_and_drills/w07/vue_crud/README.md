# Vue CRUD

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is a front end framework created by Evan You. It has become increasingly popular in the last few years for being both easy to get started and powerful enough to build complex applications.

We're going to practice building CRUD apps in Vue, but know there is limitless potential to what you can actually use it for!


### Exercise


Use the Vue.js Installation with Vue CLI cheat sheet to create a movie-vue-app. Use your Actualize preset, and make sure to install axios. Then, use the VueJS CRUD Cheat Sheet to create single page CRUD for movies.

1. Setup the backend (making sure to test the movies API)
2. In Home.vue add the ability to see all movies
3. In the same view, add movies new and create actions
4. In the same view, add the ability to see more info about a single movie (a button click)
5. In the same view, add the ability to edit/update a movie
6. In the same view, add the ability to destroy a movie
7. Test all the actions to make sure they're working properly

**Bonus: Add happy/sad paths to your axios requests to see errors that are happening in the console**


#### Deliverable
Add your movie-vue-app to github by doing a git add, commit, and push.

Then, go to the vue_crud_solution.md file in this folder and follow the instructions! Once you've completed the assignment, do this in the independent practice repository:

```bash
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "your commit message goes here"
$ git push origin YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME-GOES-HERE
```
