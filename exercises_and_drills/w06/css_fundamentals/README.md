# CSS Fundamentals

*Note: This can be a pair programming activity or done independently.*

One of the best ways to sharpen your CSS skills is to try to recreate an existing style and layout, so take a look at the deliverable below, work with a partner, and build your own version of retro Instagram.com. Don't worry if you can't get it to look exactly as you see but try your best to get as close as possible.
There's a bit of starter code, so you can jump right into it.

### Starter Code

The [starter_code](starter_code) folder contains all the files, images, and text content needed to create the page. The text is in the index.html, and the color palette is in main.css


### Exercise

- Use display, clear, and floats to position elements on the page
- Look up and use CSS properties and values that may not have been covered in class, for example:
	* background: url("yourimage.png")
	* list-style
	* text-decoration
	* text-transform
- Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages
- Use the images provided to construct the appropriate elements on the page:
	* the iPhone
	* App Store and Google Play buttons
	* Instagram Logo
	* Login button

Here's a screenshot of the final result you're aiming for:

#### Deliverable
When you're finished, go to the `css_fundamentals_solution` folder and paste in your edited html, css, and include the image files if necessary.

Once you've completed the assignment, do this in the independent practice repository:

```bash
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "your commit message goes here"
$ git push origin YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME-GOES-HERE
```
