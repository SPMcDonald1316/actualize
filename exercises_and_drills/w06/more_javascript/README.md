# More JavaScript

Now that we have a better grasp on JavaScript syntax we're going to try taking off the Ruby training wheels. 

#### Exercise


Solve the below problems directly in JavaScript (try not to use Ruby) in the `more_javascript_solution.js` file inside this folder. Remember to break down the problems into smaller steps when you get stuck. Don't worry about finding the most elegant or clever solution - focus on getting it to work!


1. Write a function that takes in an array and returns a new array with each number tripled. For example, given [3, 1, 5, 10], the function should return [9, 3, 15, 30].

2. Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array of numbers less than 5. For example, given [4, 10, 8, 3], the function should return [4, 3].

3. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers. For example, given [3, 9, 1], the function should return 13.

4. Write a function that takes in an array of strings and returns all the strings combined into a single string. For example, given ["a", "b", "c"], the function should return "abc".

5. Write a function to solve FizzBuzz (print out the numbers 1 through 100, except multiples of 3 print "Fizz", multiples of 5 print "Buzz", and multiples of 15 print "FizzBuzz").

6. Write a function that prints the lyrics to 99 Bottles of Beer.
