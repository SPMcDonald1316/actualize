# Intro to JavaScript 2

Let's keep solidifying our JavaScript syntax skills. We're going to practice practice and then practice again!

#### Exercise

Visit the [Ruby Methods 3](../ruby_methods_3) repository and use your solutions or the master_solutions if needed to solve these problems in JavaScript! You should be focused on converting the syntax, not re-solving the problems. 

Do the same for [Ruby Methods 4](../ruby_methods_4). 

#### Deliverable
Complete the exercise in the `intro_to_js_2_solution.js` file in this folder. 

Navigate to your independent practice repository and git add, commit, and push up to your branch!

```bash
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "your commit message goes here"
$ git push origin YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME-GOES-HERE
```
