# Intro to JavaScript

Since we're already pretty familiar with Ruby, we're going to use previous problems we've already solved in Ruby to help us practice JavaScript syntax. Feel free to use your Ruby/JS Syntax Cheatsheet to help you along the way.

We're now going to solve some of our ruby methods practice homework in JavaScript. 


#### Exercise

Visit the [Ruby Methods](../ruby_methods) repository from way back and use your solutions or the master_solutions if needed to solve these problems in JavaScript! You should be focused on converting the syntax, not re-solving the problems. 

Do the same for [Ruby Methods 2](../ruby_methods_2). 

#### Deliverable
Complete the exercise in the `intro_to_js_solution.js` file in this folder. 

Navigate to your independent practice repository and git add, commit, and push up to your branch!

```bash
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "your commit message goes here"
$ git push origin YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME-GOES-HERE
```
